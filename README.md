# CodeTraining

When I was an intern at the Company, I learned about building a Library Management System. It's a whole complete process to learn all the knowledge you need about building a Library system. 

The most impressive section is I clearly know how to connect front-end and back-end.

## About Library system

It has basic functions like **CRUD**, the user can insert/delete/upload/search the books. Also, this system provides the **lending record** on all the books. Users can easily know who had borrowed this book before. The last one is the **book detail**. In detail, users can quickly get the information about this book. All functions have basic **validations**. For example: wrong content, wrong date format, etc.

## Lecture 2 SQL

#### What I learned

1. Learning T-SQL by using Microsoft SQL Server

|       File       |                         Content                          |

| TableSchema.xlsx | Include database informations(table/column/data type...) |
|   Workshop.doc   |                   Ten T-SQL questions                    |
|     work.sql     |               My answer about Workshop.doc               |
